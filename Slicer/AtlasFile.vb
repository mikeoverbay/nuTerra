''' <summary>
''' A `.atlas` - which is a MANIFEST, not an image.
'''
''' This is the thing that makes `PBS_tiled_atlas_global` different from
''' `PBS_tiled`. The tiled shader names three tile textures directly; the atlas
''' shader names ONE atlas per channel and picks three tiles out of it by index,
''' which is how four of the biggest assets in the game - the mountain dam, the
''' bunker, the cooling tower and the thermal power plant - carry a lot of
''' surface variety on a small number of material slots.
'''
''' THE FILE IS 482 BYTES. It does not contain the atlas. It lists the member
''' textures and the rectangle each one occupied in the sheet, and the members
''' are ordinary `.dds` files sitting elsewhere in the packages. Older clients
''' embedded the baked sheet here as a "BCVT" chunk and current ones do not, so
''' the chunk is skipped only when it is actually present rather than assumed
''' either way.
'''
'''     i32   version, always 1
'''     i32   sheet width, i32 sheet height
'''     u32   flag, 0 or 1
'''     ...   optional "BCVT" chunk: u32, u64 size, then that many bytes
'''     then per cell:
'''     i32   x0, x1, y0, y1
'''     cstr  source path
'''
''' THE PATHS SAY `.png` AND THE FILES ARE `.dds`. Every one of them, in every
''' manifest - 880 members across the 127 atlases in the install resolve at 100%
''' once corrected and 0% before. nuTerra's MapLoader does the same replace and
''' calls it a hack; it is not really a hack, it is that the manifest records
''' the artist's source and the build converts it.
'''
''' The sheet dimensions and cell rectangles are READ AND KEPT BUT NOT USED for
''' sampling, because the sheet is never reassembled. Each member becomes its
''' own layer of a GL_TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY and `g_atlasIndexes` indexes the layer
''' directly - which is what nuTerra's shader does, and it is strictly better
''' than rebuilding the sheet: a layer is an independent, wrappable texture, so
''' a tile can repeat without bleeding into its neighbour. They are kept because
''' they are the only check that the manifest was understood - the cells must
''' tile the sheet without overlapping.
