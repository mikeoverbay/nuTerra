''' <summary>
''' Fills the flat hole in the bottom of a building.
'''
''' THE OWNER'S OBSERVATION, AND IT MEASURES OUT: these models are cut off flat
''' where they meet the ground, so the boundary at the bottom lies in one plane
''' and can simply be triangulated. No general hole-filling, no inventing a
''' surface - the ring is already planar, so a fan across it is exact.
'''
''' Measured over 128 lod0 meshes before writing this:
'''
'''     with a bottom boundary ring of 3+ edges     69   54%
'''     of those, every bottom vertex has degree 2  30   43%
'''     bottom boundary edges per mesh              median 12, mean 20, max 183
'''     with no bottom edge at all                  23
'''
''' Two things that shapes:
'''
''' * 54%, not 100%, and that is correct rather than a shortfall - a roof or a
'''   tower never touches the ground and has no bottom cut to fill. Which is
'''   also why the bottom plane is taken from the WHOLE ASSET, not per mesh: a
'''   roof's own lowest boundary is up in the air, and filling THAT would staple
'''   a lid across the eaves.
'''
''' * Only 43% of the rings are clean. The rest have a vertex of degree 1, 3 or
'''   more - T-junctions, two rings meeting at a corner, chains that do not
'''   close. So this walks components and fans whatever it finds rather than
'''   assuming a closed loop; an open chain still gets filled, and is counted so
'''   the number is visible rather than silently absorbed.
