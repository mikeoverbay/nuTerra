''' The side panel: type a pattern, get the matching `.model` files, double-click
''' one to load it.
'''
''' IT LISTS `.model` FILES, NOT ASSETS, and it lists them AT LOD 0 ONLY. The
''' `.model` is the file that names which visual to use for a LOD, so it is the
''' thing worth picking; and an asset is a kit whose lod0 holds every
''' interchangeable variant at once - loading all of them stacks two dozen
''' overlapping walls in the same cubic metre, which is what made the first OBJ
''' export unreadable. One row, one model, one mesh.
'''
''' The match is a WILDCARD, not a substring. `*` stands for any run of
''' characters and there may be as many as you like, so `*eu*house*` finds the
''' European townhouses without matching every asset with "house" in it. A
''' pattern with no `*` at all is treated as `*pattern*`, because that is what
''' someone typing three letters into a search box means.
'''
''' The matcher is written out here rather than translated into a Regex. The
''' translation needs every other metacharacter escaped, and a model path is
''' full of `_` and `.` and digits - one missed escape and the search quietly
''' matches the wrong set, which looks like a search that works.
