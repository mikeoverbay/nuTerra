''' <summary>
''' A read-only index of every World of Tanks package, built once at startup.
'''
''' Standalone on purpose - nuTerra's ResMgr does the same job but pulls in the
''' whole app to do it. Same rule as SrtViewer\PkgIndex.vb, and the same trap:
''' a ZipArchiveEntry is only valid while its ZipArchive is alive, so the
''' archives are held open for the life of the program rather than closed in a
''' Using block. The entries in `map` outlive the loop that made them.
'''
''' Unlike ResMgr this one scans EVERY package, vehicles and audio included.
''' The whole question Exporter_studio exists to answer is "where are the buildings",
''' and skipping a package because its name suggests it holds tanks is assuming
''' the answer. Run it once, measure, and then skip on evidence - which is what
''' --skip-vehicles is for, and why FoundOutsideBuildingRoot is reported.
